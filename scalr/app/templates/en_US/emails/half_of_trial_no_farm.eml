Create your first farm and put your servers on cruise control!
============================================

Hi {{firstname}},

Oh no! Today marks the end of the first half of your Scalr trial, and you have yet to set up any infrastructure. 
Scalr without servers is like Romeo without Juliet: incomplete. Perhaps I can help you with something to get going?
 
We have created a video tutorial to help you set-up your farm. You can see it http://scalr.net/how-to-get-started/#createfarm

I sense a disturbance in the force: you are about to reply!

Cheers,
